=head1 NAME

Test::S - Change test settings on the command line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Run author test

  perl -MTest::S=author test.t

Or with prove

  prove -MTest::S=author -r .

Change a few settings

  prove -MTest::S=author,smoke

Or disable certain kinds explicitly

  prove -MTest::S=no_smoke

Don't run interactive tests

  prove -MTest::S=non_interactive -r .

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::S is a shortened interface to the functionality provided by 
L<Test::Settings> for use on the command line to modify the environment on the 
fly. B<This should not be used in modules! It will not behave!>

This allows one to enable or disable certain types of tests on the command line 
without needing to set environment variables by hand.

=head2 Allowed modifiers

To use the modifiers on the command line, with many tools you can load the 
module with C<-M> and provide a comma separated list of the modifiers you want:

  perl -MTest::S=all,no_smoke

The following can all be used in combination with each other (though some 
combinations obviously cancel each other out)

=head2 Notes

B<non_interactive> means do not run interactive tests, and B<no_non_interactive> 
means run interactive tests. This can be slightly confusing.

B<all> and B<none>, if used, should be the first items in the list else they 
will override the other settings.
